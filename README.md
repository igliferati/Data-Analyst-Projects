# Data Analyst Projects SQL

This repository contains some of my SQL projects that demonstrate my skills and knowledge in data analysis, manipulation and visualization. I have used various tools and frameworks such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server to work with different types of databases and datasets. You can find the source code, data files and screenshots for each project in the corresponding folders.
